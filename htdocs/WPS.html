                <p style="text-align: justify">The West Philippine Sea is a large body of water located at the western waters of the Philippine Area of Responsibility. It refers to a eastern portion of the South China Sea itself, although it can be confused for the South China Sea as a whole. The West Philippine Sea is controlled by the Philippine government, though this has been disputed by the Republic of China. The territory of the West Philippine Sea contains Scarborough Shoal and multiple islands belonging to the Spratly group of islands.</p>

                    <h2>Scarborough Shoal</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">Scarborough Shoal, also known as Panatag Shoal is a landmass that is legally considered as a rock and is located 120 nautical miles west of Luzon. According to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (n.d.), no manmade structures have been built at Scarborough Shoal. Despite numerous sources, including maps, stating that the area is within Philippine territory, Chinese vessels patrol around the area, basically giving China control over the region.</p>

                    <h2>Spratly Islands</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">The Spratly Islands are a group of islands scattered around the southern parts of the South China Sea. Countries located near the area, such as China, Vietnam, or Malaysia, have control over different islands that are part of the Spratly Islands. However, the lists of these islands often change according to conditions presented, such as the presence of other foreign countries. With that said, however, there are nine islands or reefs located in the area that have been confirmed to be under Philippine control.<br>According to Vuving, L. (2016), these are the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Thitu Island/Pagasa Island (the largest Philippine-controlled island belonging to the Spratly group of islands)</li>
                        <li>West York Island/Likas Island</li>
                        <li>Northeast Cay/Parola Island</li>
                        <li>Nanshan Island/Lawak Island</li>
