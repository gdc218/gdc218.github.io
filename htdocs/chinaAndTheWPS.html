                    <p>The Chinese government has given aggressive responses in retaliation to the Philippines' numerous diplomatic tactics, including the signing of the administrative order which decrees that the islands falling withing the latter's Exclusive Economic Zone will be officially referred to as the West Philippine Sea. In fact, according to Bello (2011) in an interview with Heydarian, the administrative order was a psychological tactic by the Philippine Government to attack China, reasoning that "the name that always carried China (was) changed" and that "this was a psychological blow to China".</p>
                    <p>Wanting control over the territories in the West Philippine Sea, their Coast Guard has sent many patrol boats to guard the islands and landmarks in the boundaries of the West Philippine Sea. These forces have kept a strong grip over who gets to enter the area, and has caused numerous controversies which include allegedly attacking Philippine fishing boats. The Chinese government recently even passed a law that allows their coast guard to open fire on any foreign fishing boats (Al Jazeera, 2021).</p>

                    <h2>A Fragile Peace</h2>
                    <p>However, the country is seeking to resolve this issue peacefully with the Philippine government, as evidenced by the multiple visits Chinese officials have done over the years to discuss with Philippine officials. Although the situation in the West Philippine Sea looks grim and violent, representatives from both countries have discussed on multiple occasions, and the relationship between the Philippines and China has greatly improved, especially after current President Rodrigo Duterte was signed into office. According to Gomez (2020), while the Philippines still desired to have control over the territories in the West Philippine Sea, both governments still seeked to "avoid misunderstanding and resolve differences amicably".</p>
