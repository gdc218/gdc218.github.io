                    <p>Territories such as Pag-asa Island or Scarborough Shoal have always been considered part of the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, but it was only since 2011 that these islands were part of a so-called "West Philippine Sea" when then-president of the Philippines Benigno Aquino III coined the term as a way to challenge the notion that these islands were part of the South China Sea. Since then, more and more politicians and media outlets have referred to the area as the West Philippine Sea rather than the South China Sea, increasing the tension between China and the Philippines. Before September 2012, however, the term was not officially recognized by any government yet, and was rather just a term that was used occasionally by the general public.</p>

                    <h2>The Philippines Officially Declares It</h2>
                    <p>On September 5, 2012, the President of the Philippines at the time, Benigno Aquino III, signed an administrative order which stated that formally decreed that the maritime territories on the west side of the Philippines was to be called the West Philippine Sea.  According to the Philippine Government's official gazette, Administrative Order No. 29 states that the term "West Philippine Sea" was to be used to refer to the islands and landmarks that were within the west side of the country's Exclusive Economic Zone, which is formally defined in other signed declarations, namely; Presidential Decree No. 1599, signed by former president Ferdinand Marcos, and Republic Act No. 9522, signed by former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.</p>
                    <p>After the declaration, more people started using the term "West Philippine Sea", and the term became more popular in the mainstream media.</p>
